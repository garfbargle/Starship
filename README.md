# Starship

[![Build Status](http://img.shields.io/circleci/project/kylef/Starship/master.svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/kylef/Starship)

Starship is a generic API client application for iOS using
[Hyperdrive](https://github.com/the-hypermedia-project/Hyperdrive). It allows
you to connect and explore any Hypermedia or API Blueprint described API.

You can enter an API via a URL to a Hypermedia API or a domain name for an API
Bueprint hosted on Apiary. Starship will then present you the available
transitions on the API and allow you to explore it with a generated user
interface.
